# GTM Playbooks
Practical go-to-market playbooks built and used in real enterprise SaaS environments.

## What this repository is
This repo documents GTM playbooks I’ve used to:
- open new markets
- define ICPs from zero
- build outbound motions
- structure enterprise deals
- improve forecast reliability

These are not theory decks.
They are execution frameworks tested in live revenue environments.

## Playbook 1: Opening a new market from zero

**Used in:** Dots.eco, Eliq, Mailjet, Tree-Nation

### Steps
1. Define a *narrow* ICP (not “mid-market” or “enterprise”)
2. Identify one painful, urgent use case
3. Build a hypothesis-driven discovery framework
4. Run outbound manually before scaling
5. Only then add BDRs, tools, and automation

**Why it works:**  
Speed + learning beats scale at the start.

## Playbook 2: ICP definition (reality-based)

### Inputs
- Won deals
- Lost deals
- “No decision” deals
- Sales cycle length
- Stakeholder friction

### Output
A usable ICP with:
- buying trigger
- economic buyer profile
- technical blocker risks
- average deal size and cycle

**Rule:**  
If sales can’t explain *why* a deal closed, the ICP is wrong.

## Playbook 3: Enterprise discovery structure

I use a MEDDPICC-based structure focused on **signal**, not qualification theater.

### Core areas
- Business pain (quantified)
- Decision process (real, not theoretical)
- Ownership and urgency
- Technical and security blockers
- Success definition

Discovery is successful when the **customer reframes the problem themselves**.

## Playbook 4: Outbound that doesn’t feel like outbound

### Principles
- No feature-first messaging
- One clear hypothesis per outreach
- Role-specific framing
- Short feedback loops

### What scales
- Angles scale
- Templates don’t

Outbound is a learning system, not a volume game.

---

## Playbook 5: Deal reviews & forecasting

### What I review weekly
- MEDDPICC gaps
- Decision confidence (not optimism)
- Next-step ownership
- Close plan realism

**Forecast rule:**  
If you can’t explain *why* a deal will close this quarter, it won’t.

## Playbook 6: GTM as a team sport

Enterprise GTM only works when:
- Sales, CS, Product, and Marketing share signal
- Feedback loops are short
- Ego is low and structure is high

The best reps create clarity for everyone, not just pipeline.

---

## Operating principles
- Start narrow, then scale
- Signal > activity
- Structure creates freedom
- GTM is built, not “hacked”

---

## Final note
These playbooks evolve.
If reality changes, the playbook changes.
