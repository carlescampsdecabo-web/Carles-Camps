# AI for GTM
Practical ways I use AI to improve enterprise go-to-market execution.

## Why this exists
This repository documents how I use AI as a practical GTM tool — not as a buzzword.

My focus is on:
- improving discovery quality
- scaling personalization without losing signal
- increasing deal clarity and forecast accuracy
- reducing manual work in enterprise sales motions

These are real workflows and experiments used in live sales environments.

## Where AI actually helps in GTM

### 1. Discovery preparation
- Rapid account research before first calls
- Hypothesis-driven discovery prompts
- Mapping likely stakeholders and buying dynamics

**Outcome:** sharper first conversations, less generic discovery.

---

### 2. ICP and segmentation refinement
- Pattern analysis across won / lost deals
- Translating qualitative feedback into ICP signals
- Stress-testing assumptions on verticals and buyer personas

**Outcome:** clearer ICP and better outbound focus.

---

### 3. Outbound personalization at scale
- First-line and angle generation based on account context
- Message variation by role and maturity stage
- Avoiding template fatigue while keeping consistency

**Outcome:** higher reply quality, not just higher volume.

---

### 4. Deal reviews and forecasting
- MEDDPICC deal summaries
- Risk and gap detection before forecast calls
- Structured next-step clarity

**Outcome:** better deal hygiene and predictability.

## Example prompts I actually use

**Discovery prep**
"Based on this company’s product, customers, and org size, what are the most likely operational and strategic pains related to [X]?"

**Deal risk check**
"Review this MEDDPICC summary and highlight the biggest risks or missing signals."

**Outbound angle testing**
"Generate three value hypotheses for a [role] at a [industry] company facing [context]."

## Tools & stack
- ChatGPT / LLMs
- Voiceflow (AI-driven onboarding & support)
- CRM (Salesforce / HubSpot)
- Notion for deal & ICP documentation

AI is a co-pilot — judgment stays human.

## Operating principles
- AI supports thinking, it doesn’t replace it
- Output quality depends on question quality
- Structure beats volume
- Sales is a team sport

---

## Final note
This repo is intentionally practical.
If it’s not improving clarity, velocity, or signal — I don’t use it.
