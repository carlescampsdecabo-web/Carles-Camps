Sales is a team sport. I build GTM systems that scale without losing the human touch.

Hi, I’m Carles 👋

I build and scale go-to-market motions for B2B SaaS companies, with a focus on enterprise sales, outbound systems, and AI-enabled workflows.

Over the last 16+ years, I’ve helped companies open new markets across EMEA & LATAM, close complex enterprise deals, and turn early GTM chaos into repeatable, predictable revenue.

## What I work on

- Enterprise GTM & new market entry (from zero → repeatable)
- Outbound systems (ICP, signals, sequencing, deal hygiene)
- Consultative selling in complex, multi-stakeholder environments
- Applying AI to sales workflows without losing human judgment

---

## Recent work I’m proud of

- Built and scaled an enterprise GTM motion from scratch at **Dots.eco**, reaching ~€0.8M annualized revenue in year one, with ~90% new business.
- Opened and scaled new markets in Spain, Portugal, EMEA and LATAM at companies like **Mailjet, Tree-Nation, and Eliq**.
- Closed enterprise SaaS and consulting deals up to €1M ARR using structured discovery and MEDDPICC-based qualification.

## How I operate

- Data-driven, low-ego, and comfortable in ambiguity
- Strong believer that sales is a **team sport**
- I care as much about process and consistency as I do about closing
- I use AI to augment thinking and execution — not to replace it

## What you’ll find here

This GitHub is where I share practical GTM artifacts:
- Playbooks and templates I actually use
- Outbound and account research frameworks
- AI-assisted sales workflows and prompts
- Notes from building and scaling GTM motions

Nothing theoretical. Everything tested.
